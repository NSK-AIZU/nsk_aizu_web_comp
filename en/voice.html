                        <p class="voice-card__answer">
                            Through working in agriculture, I learned that there are many farmlands that have lost their owners. As the population declines, so do connections between people. So instead of building something new, why not revive the places that were once used and turn them into spaces where people can connect? That's why I started NSK_AIZU.

                            I started getting involved through a cooking event. I haven't been able to join the farming activities much, but through these activities the community has grown, and meeting new people has been the best part for me.

                            First, to have our own field. That's the biggest goal. Not just helping out, but growing, harvesting, and delivering — experiencing the whole process ourselves. I feel like something new will come from that.
